                          <p>Write Smart is an intelligent writing application which can understand and evaluate the given block of text. It can give meaningful insights about the text like sentence parsing, word braking, spotting common errors, topic detection and give suggesstions about next word completions and much more.</p>
                          <p>Write Smart is created with accessibility as a prime focus, where it can convert Speech to text and vice versa. This gives the ability for the speaker to just dictate the content and it will transform the speech to written text.</p>
                          <p>Write Smart is capable of mapping the <strong>Constituency Tree</strong> and <strong>Part-of-Speech Tags</strong> in the given text. This helps us to process the given text and provide the learner to understand how their content is structured thus helping them increase their language writing skills.</p>
